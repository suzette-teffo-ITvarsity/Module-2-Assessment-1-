                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>The giraffe (Giraffa) is an African artiodactyl mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to eight extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils,The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
<p>Giraffes may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p>
<p>ully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females.The tallest recorded male was 5.88 m (19.3 ft) and the tallest recorded female was 5.17 m (17.0 ft) tall.The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female with maximum weights of 1,930 kg (4,250 lb) and 1,180 kg (2,600 lb) having been recorded for males and females, respectively.Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe's body is relatively short.[49]:66 Located at both sides of the head, the giraffe's large, bulging eyes give it good all-round vision from its great height.Giraffes see in colour[50]:26 and their senses of hearing and smell are also sharp.The animal can close its muscular nostrils to protect against sandstorms and ants.</p>
<p>Humans have interacted with giraffes for millennia. They were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the Kiffians, Egyptians, and Kushites.[50]:45–47 The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the "world's largest rock art petroglyph".The San people of southern Africa have medicine dances named after some animals; the giraffe dance is performed to treat head ailments.How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales,[14] including one from eastern Africa which explains that the giraffe grew tall from eating too many magic herbs.[114] According to a tale in Tanzania, the giraffe was given both its height and silence when it asked the creator for the gift of wisdom. It could now see and hear all but it could not speak as "silence is wisdom".The Dinka people of the Sudan have traditionally considered the giraffe to be their clan animal and the earthly representative of their deity.The Tugen people of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda.</p>
<p>Male giraffes use their necks as weapons in combat, a behaviour known as "necking". Necking is used to establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success.This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then get ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing', A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are.Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.</p>
