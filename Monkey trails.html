                            <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
    <p>Take a walk or ride through this challenging obstacle course</p>
    <p>Monkey Trails takes you directly through the tree canopy, where you can observe them from two perspectives: tree-branch or ground level. Look for lesser spot-nosed monkeys, a lively troop of capuchin monkeys, colobus monkeys and northern black-crested mangabeys sharing an exhibit, and Wolf’s monkeys hanging out with their friends.while just across the path, you’ll find these other species alongside. There’s never a dull moment in these mixed-species groups.</p>
                      
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>The monkey trail is at the west right after the entrance and amphitheatre</p>
